This code is a Java implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using Swing for the GUI. Here's a breakdown of its structure and functionality:

- The TicTacToe class implements the ActionListener interface to handle button clicks.
- It creates a JFrame and divides it into three panels: title_panel, button_panel, and reset_panel.
- The title_panel contains a JLabel displaying the game title.
- The button_panel contains 9 JButtons arranged in a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe grid.
- The reset_panel contains a JButton to reset the game.
- The game alternates between players, represented by "X" and "O", and updates the textfield accordingly.
- It checks for win conditions after each move and updates the textfield with the winner or a draw message.
- If a win or draw occurs, it disables all buttons to prevent further moves until the game is reset.
- The reset() method resets the game by clearing the button texts, enabling all buttons, and starting a new turn.

Overall, this code provides a functional graphical Tic Tac Toe game interface with basic gameplay mechanics.
